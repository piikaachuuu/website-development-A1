                <h2>A crochet pattern is a guide that shows you how to create a specific crochet item. It includes the materials you need, step-by-step instructions and details on how to finish the project. Most patterns use simple abbreviations and symbols, and they may also come with charts or video tutorials. A pattern tells you exactly which stitches to make and when to use them, helping you complete your project with confidence.</h2>
                <br>Below are the steps to learn crochet patterns step by step:<h2>

                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">A slip knot is the first step in starting a crochet project. It's a simple adjustable loop that lets you attach the yarn securely to your hook before you begin crocheting</div>

            <section class="pattern-section" id="magic-ring">
                <h3>What is Magic Ring?</h3>
                <div class="video-responsive">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p298HxgsO1s?si=cSlO5tNgwRF43BQS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">A magic ring also known as a magic circle or adjustable loop, is a method used to begin crochet projects that are worked in the round such as amigurumi. It creates a tight, adjustable loop that prevents a hole from forming in the center. With this technique, you crochet your first round of stitches into the loop and then pull the yarn tail to close it neatly.</div>

            <section class="pattern-section" id="chain">
                <h3>What is Chain?</h3>

                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7v-mssy5rKU?si=efa10jadkfr8HshF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">A crochet chain is one of the most basic stitches in crochet and is made by creating a series of connected loops. This chain often serves as the starting point for a project, where it's known as the 'foundation chain.' Chains are also used throughout patterns to add space, create length or form decorative designs.</div>

            <section class="pattern-section" id="slip-stitch">
                <h3>What is Slip Stitch (Slst)?</h3>

                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ir3v31G0sg?si=FMq_gVuJCV7KuPpi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">A slip stitch is the shortest and simplest crochet stitch, often used to join parts of your work or move the yarn without adding height. To make a slip stitch, you insert the hook into a stitch, yarn over and pull the yarn through both the stitch and the loop on your hook in one smooth motion. This stitch is especially important for connecting rounds in crochet projects.</div>

            <section class="pattern-section" id="single-crochet">
                <h3>What is Single Crochet (SC)?</h3>
                <div class="video-responsive">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7FcRdxg0aeY?si=ZKRp7xE1gyorlMVK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">A single crochet often written as 'SC' is one of the simplest and most commonly used crochet stitches. It creates a tight, solid texture that's great for many types of projects. To make a single crochet, you insert your hook into a stitch, yarn over, pull up a loop then yarn over again and pull through booth loops on the hook.</div>

            <section class="pattern-section" id="double-crochet">
                <h3>What is Double Crochet (DC)?</h3>
                <div class="video-responsive">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1whu6Gub1M?si=EebSOG7Ll4jEGhMN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">A double crochet is a taller stitch than a single crochet and is made using a few simple yarn overs and pulls. To create a double crochet, you start by yarning over, inserting your hook into the next stitch, and pulling up a loop so you have three loops on your hook. Then, yarn over and pull through the first two loops, leaving two loops. Yarn over one more time and pull through the remaining two loops to finish the stitch. This stitch works up quickly and gives your project a more open, flexible texture.</div>
            </section>

            <section class="pattern-section" id="half-double-crochet">
                <h3>What is Half Double Crochet (HDC)?</h3>
                <div class="video-responsive">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9C1C21MNiM?si=yGA3cAA3gETipzed" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">The half double crochet (HDC) is a stitch that creates a texture that's thicker than a double crochet but not as tight as a single crochet. To make an HDC, you yarn over, insert your hook into the next stitch, yarn over again and pull up a loop so you have three loops on your hook. Then yarn over once more and pull through all three loops at the same time. This stitch is quick to work and gives your project a nice balanced texture.</div>

            <section class="pattern-section" id="increase">
                <h3>What is Increase (Inc)?</h3>
                <div class="video-responsive">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvD1qrrRX5c?si=QrljbSzRwT7uL2nq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">An increase in crochet is when you make two or more stitches into the same stitch or space from the previous row, adding extra stitches to your work. This helps shape your project, especially when creating flat circles, amigurumi, or anything that needs to get wider. The most common type of increase is making two single crochets in one stitch, but you can also increase using other stitches like double crochet. The exact method depends on the pattern and the look you want to achieve.</div>

            <section class="pattern-section" id="decrease">
                <h3>What is Decrease (Dec)?</h3>
                <div class="video-responsive">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXsiVk52_vA?si=LNZEh70QiOpXu0MY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">A decrease in crochet is a method used to turn two stitches into one, reducing the number of stitches in your row or round. This technique helps shape your project by narrowing the fabric. To decrease, you begin working into two stitches separately but finish them as a single stitch. The abbreviation for a decrease is 'Dec.'</div>

            <section class="pattern-section" id="flo">
                <h3>What is Front Loop (FLO)?</h3>
                <div class="video-responsive">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CUsVbI7h9_w?si=Zk7-ohFarIdAiuNi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">The front loop in crochet is the part of the stitch that sits closest to you. When a pattern says to work “in the front loop only” (FLO), you insert your hook under just that loop and leave the back loop untouched. This technique creates a visible ridge and adds texture or special effects to your project.</div>
            </section>

            <section class="pattern-section" id="blo">
                <h3>What is Back Loop (BLO)?</h3>
                <div class="video-responsive">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCiq2VB7jH4?si=4nOjimUdQxi2k8LU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="video-desc">The back loop in crochet is the part of the stitch farthest from you. When a pattern instructs you to work in the “back loop only” (BLO), you insert your hook under just that loop, leaving the front loop unworked. This technique creates a raised ridge and adds texture, flexibility, or decorative detail to your project.</div>
